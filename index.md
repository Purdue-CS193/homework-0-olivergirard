# Oliver Girard's First CS193 Homework

- The class is taught by undergraduate students which makes the idea of asking questions much less scary.
- Turns out I knew less about programming than I thought I did, so this course guides me through the basics as opposed to me searching for help on my own.
- The room has desks! Some of my classes have none.
